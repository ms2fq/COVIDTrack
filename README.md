# COVIDTrack

This is an ongoing project!

COVIDTrack is a web application that is used to track the latest Coronavirus statistics in the United States.

It was developed using the Spring Boot framework.

Current plans for this project include:
* Creating a main page with two drop down menus
  * These drop down menus would allow for a user to select the state and county to see the latest COVID-19 statistics
* Creating a visualization (e.g. a graph or chart) to see the trends of the COVID-19 statistics
* Creating tests for this project

The data used in this project is from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, and can be found at this link:
